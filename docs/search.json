      "contents": "\r\nLuckily processing camera trap data has been made much easier with Wildlife Insights.\r\nThere are great tutorials on how to use Wildlife Insights already: https://youtu.be/LiWZVpqzumc\r\nHere is the full guide:\r\n\r\nDownload Wildlife Insights Getting Started Guide - ENG - Shared.pdf\r\n\r\nData analysis starts with having all of the photos organized into folders by deployment (location and camera used), and having a table with the metadata deployment details. To fill out this metadata table and double check that everything is correct I went through all of the field sheets for deployment and collection, making sure that collection dates on the sheets match up with the folder names. I then went into the timelapse folder from each camera deployment and noted the date of the last timelapse marker (to confirm that the camera traps were operating until the collection date). As was noted during collection of AZCAM05, it had been turned off at a previous visit and not turned back on. The timelapse markers show the actual date range the cameras were operating.\r\nClick here for notes on camera deployment dates\r\n\r\n\r\n#AZCAM12 had a messed up schedule. This camera was originally placed at a different location (the point was unnecessarily moved when first established, then moved back to original position). The timelapse (and photos taken), include the first location (which will be excluded from analysis). The set date in the metadata is the day the camera was moved to its final position. However, the timelapse shows that the camera was not in continuous operation. This is because this camera was positioned on a tree that was too thin and moved in the wind, resulting in 38,000 photos. The actual dates of operation for AZCAM12 are: 20240202-20240211, 20240304-20240311\r\n\r\n#AZCAM23, another one placed on too skinny a tree that collected thousands of photos, cut out a few days before the collection date.\r\n\r\n#AZCAM25 was programmed with the wrong date, behind one month. So, it was set in the field on the 2nd of February, but the first timelapse marker date is from the 2nd of January. Consequently, because February this year has 2 fewer days than January, the timelapse maker end date is 10th of February, which corresponds to the actual collection date of 12th of March.\r\n\r\n#AZCAM38 cut out a few days early. Maybe from many photos? (it was in a horse pasture, 6900 photos)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the metadata table:\r\n\r\n\r\ncamtrap_metadata <- read.csv(\"media/working directory/data/camtrap_metadata.csv\",header = T, sep = \",\")\r\n\r\nlibrary(DT)\r\n\r\ndatatable(camtrap_metadata, rownames = FALSE, width = \"100%\", colnames = c(\"camera\", \"point\", \"finca\", \"sd.card\", \"set.date\", \"collect.date\", \"timelapse.end\", \"range\", \"program\", \"hard.drive1\", \"folder\", \"notes\"),\r\n          caption =\r\n            htmltools::tags$caption(\r\n              style = \"caption-side: bottom; text-align: left;\",\r\n              \"Table: \",\r\n              htmltools::em(\"blob variables and Categories\")),\r\n          extensions = \"Buttons\",\r\n          options = list(columnDefs =\r\n                           list(list(className = \"dt-left\", targets = 0)),\r\n                         dom = \"Blfrtip\", pageLength = 10,\r\n                         lengthMenu = c(10, 20, 40, 70),\r\n                         buttons = c(\"csv\", \"copy\")))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven simpler:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nI have about 135 hours of total acoustic recordings per point,\r\ncollected with audiomoths.\r\nThe first ~50 hours of recordings are with a schedule I had intended\r\nto collect 120 hours over 30 days, but the rechargable batteries did not\r\nhold up. These were recorded with this schedule: 4:00-12:00,\r\n16:00-24:00; record 15 seconds/sleep 45 seconds; 48 kHz.\r\nThe next ~85 hours per point were collected more or less continuously\r\n(0:00-24:00; record 895 seconds/sleep 5 seconds; 48 kHz). I chose to\r\nbreak this up into 15 minute chunks so that the files will be easier to\r\nmove around. These were collected using alkaline batteries, and not\r\nhitting 120 hours was also a disappointment.\r\nI also have ~4 hours of recordings (17:00-24:00; record 15/sleep 165;\r\n384 kHz) for [18] points, intended for bat monitoring. Will deal with\r\nthat later.\r\nNote for when I start analyzing the data from Ponterra and\r\nsupplemental Pro Eco Azuero data: the schedule was back to 15 seconds a\r\nminute for part of the day (4:00-12:00, 16:00-24:00; record 15\r\nseconds/sleep 45 seconds; 48 kHz). This time we used alkaline batteries\r\nand enabled energy saver mode.\r\nTo get bird richness data from these recordings I will use BirdNet.\r\n\r\nExcerpt from email from Tim Boycott, who is doing his PhD at\r\nthe Cornell Lab of Ornithology:\r\nWe run our audio data through BirdNet using the command line\r\ninterface. We leave default sensitivity (1) and overlap (0) and passed a\r\ndefined list of ~120 species. For 9TB of audio data from last season, it\r\ntook about a week to run on a good but not crazy powerful laptop.\r\nWe then go through a validation process (expert ID of a subset of\r\ndetections) to impart a confidence level on BirdNet scores. This was an\r\napproach developed by Connor Wood (one of our collaborators) and Stefan\r\nKahl (the developer of BirdNet), so we feel pretty good about this\r\nroute. I’m attaching their paper, a tutorial with example data, and our\r\nown R markdown that we developed for our project on grassland birds in\r\nNY.\r\nIn a nutshell, for each species, we validate 100 detections (using\r\nthe 3 second audio segments produced by the BirdNet workflow) with\r\nBirdNet scores between 0.1-1.0 and another 50 detections with scores\r\nbetween 0.85-1.0. This tends to be enough to fit a logistic regression\r\nand get a 95% CL on score cutoff levels for each species. We then filter\r\nthe entire raw dataset by those 95% CL BirdNet scores and retain only\r\ndetections above those scores for downstream analyses.\r\nOne important thing to remember is that once you use a current\r\nversion of BirdNet in this process, you shouldn’t update to a new\r\nversion, as the algorithm changes will produce different scores,\r\nrequiring revalidating of the data. However, once you go through this\r\nvalidation step for one season of data, under a specific experimental\r\ndesign, in a given set of locations, you arguably don’t need to\r\nrevalidate in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nHere is the paper he referenced:\r\n\r\nDownload wood-kahl-2024-guidelines-for-birdnet-scores.pdf\r\n\r\nSo, first step is to figure out how to run birdnet with command line:\r\nhttps://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-cli\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\nContents\r\nData cleanup\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil invertebrates are incredibly diverse. To put things in perspective: Perching birds (this includes more than half of all bird species worldwide) are in the single order Passeriformes. A single soil sample from a mature forest can contain more than twenty different orders of animals! Most soil organisms in the tropics are undescribed species - if you look at a sample under the microscope you are likely to be the first human to ever lay eyes on at least a few species. These tiny creature also play a critical role in the carbon cycle, contributing to decomposition of plant material and cycling nutrients in the soil.\r\nImportant for the context of holistic biodiversity monitoring, soil fauna are very location-specific. A mammal observation at a particular point does not necessarily give too much information about the quality of habitat at that point for the mammal - the mammal could just be passing through between places that it actually eats, sleeps and mates. On the other hand, soil fauna have vastly smaller home ranges, and in all likelihood spend their entire lives within a few meters of the sampling point. So, in a patchy landscape with a lot of disturbance they are better indicators of conditions at a particular sampling point.\r\nBrief summary of what I will be doing with my soil invert data:\r\nClean up and prepare for vegan R package\r\nCalculate invertebrate richness at each sampling point, as well as abundance of all taxa across points and land use types\r\nCalculate Shannon, Simpson and other diversity indices for each land use type\r\nRun some ordinations to look at community composition differences between land use types.\r\nVisualize abundance for all orders in relation to land use to see which are most sensitive.\r\nIf I have enough temperature data from this first round of sampling see if temperature mediates invertebrate response to land use (I suspect it does). The moisture data is unfortunately pretty low resolution, but that probably also plays a very important role.\r\nData cleanup\r\nHere is a .csv file with raw data for the invert pilot study:\r\n\r\nDownload Soil invert data.csv\r\n\r\nThis spreadsheet is a combination of the invertebrate abundance data and the collection/extraction metadata, in long format. I will start with some clean up and organization. This involves making sure that R reads my dates as dates, converting my data to long format, splitting the dataset in two (one with unknowns and one without), correcting abundance data for sample mass, and splitting the data into absolute and relative abundance. I use absolute abundance data for calculating diversity indices and relative abundance for community structure modelling.\r\nClick here for setup information.\r\n\r\n\r\ndata <- read.csv('media/working directory/data/soil invert data.csv')\r\n\r\n#load packages\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(gridExtra)\r\nlibrary('funrar')\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\n\r\n## Initial cleanup, organization\r\n\r\n#make dates recognizable by R\r\ndata$collect.date <- ymd(data$collect.date)\r\n\r\n#Add 0 abundance for unobserved taxa\r\ndata$count[is.na(data$count)] <- 0\r\n\r\n#remove excess rows from dataframe\r\ndata<-data[which(complete.cases(data$collect.date)),]\r\n\r\n#create dataset with unknowns (for total abundance)\r\ndata.unknown<-data\r\n\r\n#create dataset without unknowns (for diversity and community composition)\r\ndata <- subset(data, !taxon == \"Unknown\",)\r\n\r\n#make my data wide for vegan package\r\nwide.data <- data %>%\r\n  pivot_wider(names_from = taxon, values_from = count)\r\n\r\n#make same wide dataframe for data with unknowns\r\nwide.data.unknown <- data.unknown %>%\r\n  pivot_wider(names_from = taxon, values_from = count)\r\n\r\n#Splitting data frame into count and environmental data\r\nwide.data2<-wide.data[,-c(1:12)]     \r\nwide.data3<-wide.data[,-c(13:66)]\r\nwide.data.unknown2<-wide.data.unknown[,-c(1:12)]\r\nwide.data.unknown3<-wide.data.unknown[,-c(13:67)]\r\n\r\n# Converting to count per dry mass\r\n\r\n#converting to count/1000g\r\nwide.data2 <- (1000/wide.data3$dry.mass)*wide.data2\r\nwide.data.unknown2 <- (1000/wide.data.unknown3$dry.mass)*wide.data.unknown2\r\n\r\n#Next I convert mass-corrected absolute abundance to relative abundance, which is used later for total abundance, individual taxon abundance, and community structure modelling. \r\n\r\n#Before the conversion I create data frames backing up the mass-corrected absolute count data for diversity index calculations. \r\n\r\n#Creating versions of the count data that are corrected for mass, but not made relative (for diversity indexes)\r\nwide.data.absolute <- wide.data2\r\nwide.data.unknown.absolute <- wide.data.unknown2\r\n\r\n#reincorporating, and duplicating mass-corrected absolute count data (only doing it for unknowns because this data frame will be used for abundance)\r\nwide.data.unknown[,c(13:67)] <- wide.data.unknown.absolute\r\nwide.data.unknown.absolute2 <- wide.data.unknown\r\n\r\n#converting absolute to relative abundance\r\nwide.data2 <- as.matrix(wide.data2)\r\nwide.data.unknown2 <- as.matrix(wide.data.unknown2)\r\nwide.data2 <- make_relative(wide.data2)\r\nwide.data.unknown2 <- make_relative(wide.data.unknown2)\r\nwide.data2 <- as.data.frame(wide.data2)\r\nwide.data.unknown2 <- as.data.frame(wide.data.unknown2)\r\n\r\n#reincorporating mass-corrected relative count data into original data frame\r\nwide.data[,c(13:66)] <- wide.data2\r\nwide.data.unknown[,c(13:67)] <- wide.data.unknown2\r\n\r\n\r\nNext up I’ll calculate richness, evenness, total abundance, and several diversity indices using the ‘vegan’ R package.

You can embed an R code\r\nchunk like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(cars)\r\n\r\n     speed           dist       \r\n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \r\n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \r\n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \r\n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \r\n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \r\n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \r\n\r\nIncluding Plots\r\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the\r\ncode chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the\r\nplot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
