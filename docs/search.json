      "contents": "\r\nLuckily processing camera trap data has been made much easier with Wildlife Insights.\r\nThere are great tutorials on how to use Wildlife Insights already: https://youtu.be/LiWZVpqzumc\r\nHere is the full guide:\r\n\r\nDownload Wildlife Insights Getting Started Guide - ENG - Shared.pdf\r\n\r\nData analysis starts with having all of the photos organized into folders by deployment (location and camera used), and having a table with the metadata deployment details. To fill out this metadata table and double check that everything is correct I went through all of the field sheets for deployment and collection, making sure that collection dates on the sheets match up with the folder names. I then went into the timelapse folder from each camera deployment and noted the date of the last timelapse marker (to confirm that the camera traps were operating until the collection date). As was noted during collection of AZCAM05, it had been turned off at a previous visit and not turned back on. The timelapse markers show the actual date range the cameras were operating.\r\nClick here for notes on camera deployment dates\r\n\r\n\r\n#AZCAM12 had a messed up schedule. This camera was originally placed at a different location (the point was unnecessarily moved when first established, then moved back to original position). The timelapse (and photos taken), include the first location (which will be excluded from analysis). The set date in the metadata is the day the camera was moved to its final position. However, the timelapse shows that the camera was not in continuous operation. This is because this camera was positioned on a tree that was too thin and moved in the wind, resulting in 38,000 photos. The actual dates of operation for AZCAM12 are: 20240202-20240211, 20240304-20240311\r\n\r\n#AZCAM23, another one placed on too skinny a tree that collected thousands of photos, cut out a few days before the collection date.\r\n\r\n#AZCAM25 was programmed with the wrong date, behind one month. So, it was set in the field on the 2nd of February, but the first timelapse marker date is from the 2nd of January. Consequently, because February this year has 2 fewer days than January, the timelapse maker end date is 10th of February, which corresponds to the actual collection date of 12th of March.\r\n\r\n#AZCAM38 cut out a few days early. Maybe from many photos? (it was in a horse pasture, 6900 photos)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the metadata table:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took a long time to upload the photos to wildlife insights, even with solid wifi. It took about a week and a half of uploads (in the background while I do other stuff), average of a few hours a day upload, maybe 20 hours total(?) for 78,019 photos from 49 points. I did not upload the four points that had the most photos because those four points together represent 101,556 photos. Uploading them will take ages, as will sorting through the photos, so I decided to put that off and focus on the first 49. These first 49 cameras have 2196 camera-days’ worth of data, so a solid sampling effort.\r\n\r\nStudy design recommendation from Kays et al 2020 ‘An empirical evaluation of camera trap study design: How\r\nmany, how long and when?’\r\n“Based on these analyses, we recommend that studies aimed at estimating species richness and relative abundance/occupancy of mammal species use arrays of at least 40–60 camera traps run for 3–5 weeks.”\r\nThat’s 840 to 2100 camera days. The first 49 cameras already beat that, with the rest of the Ponterra/PEA data we’ll have double the max recomendation. Certainly hope it’s enough to oversaturate the data and know how far we can scale back for large-scale implementation.\r\n\r\nThe four points I didn’t upload yet are the worst, though others definitely were bad too. These cameras took so many photos due to windy conditions, camera placement on too thin trees (that sway in big winds), or inadequate removal of vegetation from in front of the camera. During fieldwork I had a policy of minimal alteration to the environment a the sampling sites, we did not even bring machetes to the field. In the future I will adjust this policy a bit to make sure there are no plants in the immediate vicinity of the camera that could cause thousands of blank photos in high wind. The mature forest sites had fewer photos, likely due to thicker trees and more buffering of wind in the understory. The greatest number of photos were from pasture sites, where the cameras were mounted on thinner trees that had greater wind exposure, and in teak plantation, where the leaf litter was sufficiently large and decomposition-resistant that it stirred enough in the wind to trigger the cameras. Dry season is windier than wet season, so hopefully wet season sampling has fewer blank photos, and I will be more mindful of tree thickness. Perhaps I can also reconsider mounting cameras on stakes at pasture sites.\r\nSorting these images also takes a while - how long really depends on what is in them and how the AI classified things. If the camera was in a field on a skinny tree that moved a bunch, I got thousands of photos but it wasn’t too difficult to sort through as the photo itself wasn’t too structurally complex and I could generally scan through them quickly. If the camera was in denser understory with a large leave in front that moved a lot, it also produced thousands of photos, but the structural complexity of the scene meant more time was needed to sort through.\r\nVery few of the photos marked as blank by the AI had an animal in them (well less than 1%, not actually measured), so I decided to start by sorting the ‘not blank’ photos - those for which an animal was identified or there was no confident computer vision result. This took a couple of days of work for ~25k photos. This includes blanks of cameras that had fewer photos, to have a better understanding of how blank the blanks are. Now that the photos not manually sorted on wildlife insights are confident blanks, I download the data:\r\n\r\nDownload sequences.csv\r\n\r\nWhich came along with some metadata:\r\n\r\nDownload projects.csv\r\nDownload images_2007494.csv\r\nDownload deployments.csv\r\nDownload cameras.csv\r\n\r\nI will mostly be following these instructions for analysis.\r\nHowever, let’s first see if we can do some of the same things with this as I did for soil fauna, at least richness by land use:\r\nClick here for code\r\n\r\n\r\ncam.data <- read.csv('media/working directory/data/camera data first 53/sequences.csv')\r\ncam.metadata <- read.csv('media/working directory/data/camtrap_metadata.csv')\r\n\r\n#these are all the things we saw (excluding humans, which were already filtered out)\r\ntaxa <- unique(cam.data$common_name)   \r\ncam.data$points <- substr(cam.data$deployment_id, 0, 7)\r\npoints <- unique(cam.data$points)\r\nsort(points)\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\n\r\ndf <- cam.data %>% group_by(common_name) %>% summarize(n())\r\ndf.wild <- df[!(df$common_name %in% \"Domestic Horse\"),]\r\ndf.wild <- df.wild[!(df.wild$common_name %in% \"Domestic Cattle\"),]\r\n\r\n\r\npie(df.wild$`n()`, labels = df.wild$common_name)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nI have about 135 hours of total acoustic recordings per point, collected with audiomoths.\r\nThe first ~50 hours of recordings are with a schedule I had intended to collect 120 hours over 30 days, but the rechargable batteries did not hold up. These were recorded with this schedule: 4:00-12:00, 16:00-24:00; record 15 seconds/sleep 45 seconds; 48 kHz.\r\nThe next ~85 hours per point were collected more or less continuously (0:00-24:00; record 895 seconds/sleep 5 seconds; 48 kHz). I chose to break this up into 15 minute chunks so that the files will be easier to move around. These were collected using alkaline batteries, and not hitting 120 hours was also a disappointment.\r\nI also have ~4 hours of recordings (17:00-24:00; record 15/sleep 165; 384 kHz) for [18] points, intended for bat monitoring. Will deal with that later.\r\nNote for when I start analyzing the data from Ponterra and supplemental Pro Eco Azuero data: the schedule was back to 15 seconds a minute for part of the day (4:00-12:00, 16:00-24:00; record 15 seconds/sleep 45 seconds; 48 kHz). This time we used alkaline batteries and enabled energy saver mode.\r\nTo get bird richness data from these recordings I will use BirdNet.\r\n\r\nExcerpt from email from Tim Boycott, who is doing his PhD at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology:\r\nWe run our audio data through BirdNet using the command line interface. We leave default sensitivity (1) and overlap (0) and passed a defined list of ~120 species. For 9TB of audio data from last season, it took about a week to run on a good but not crazy powerful laptop.\r\nWe then go through a validation process (expert ID of a subset of detections) to impart a confidence level on BirdNet scores. This was an approach developed by Connor Wood (one of our collaborators) and Stefan Kahl (the developer of BirdNet), so we feel pretty good about this route. I’m attaching their paper, a tutorial with example data, and our own R markdown that we developed for our project on grassland birds in NY.\r\nIn a nutshell, for each species, we validate 100 detections (using the 3 second audio segments produced by the BirdNet workflow) with BirdNet scores between 0.1-1.0 and another 50 detections with scores between 0.85-1.0. This tends to be enough to fit a logistic regression and get a 95% CL on score cutoff levels for each species. We then filter the entire raw dataset by those 95% CL BirdNet scores and retain only detections above those scores for downstream analyses.\r\nOne important thing to remember is that once you use a current version of BirdNet in this process, you shouldn’t update to a new version, as the algorithm changes will produce different scores, requiring revalidating of the data. However, once you go through this validation step for one season of data, under a specific experimental design, in a given set of locations, you arguably don’t need to revalidate in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nHere is the paper he referenced:\r\n\r\nDownload wood-kahl-2024-guidelines-for-birdnet-scores.pdf\r\n\r\nSo, first step is to figure out how to run birdnet with command line: https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-cli\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To put things in perspective: Perching birds (this includes more than half of all bird species worldwide) are in the single order Passeriformes. A single soil sample from a mature forest can contain more than twenty different orders of animals! Most soil organisms in the tropics are undescribed species - if you look at a sample under the microscope you are likely to be the first human to ever lay eyes on at least a few species. These tiny creature also play a critical role in the carbon cycle, contributing to decomposition of plant material and cycling nutrients in the soil.\r\nImportant for the context of holistic biodiversity monitoring, soil fauna are very location-specific. A mammal observation at a particular point does not necessarily give too much information about the quality of habitat at that point for the mammal - the mammal could just be passing through between places that it actually eats, sleeps and mates. On the other hand, soil fauna have vastly smaller home ranges, and in all likelihood spend their entire lives within a few meters of the sampling point. So, in a patchy landscape with a lot of disturbance they are better indicators of conditions at a particular sampling point.\r\nBrief summary of what I will be doing with my soil invert data:\r\nClean up and prepare for vegan R package\r\nCalculate invertebrate richness at each sampling point, as well as abundance of all taxa across points and land use types\r\nCalculate Shannon, Simpson and other diversity indices for each land use type\r\nRun some ordinations to look at community composition differences between land use types.\r\nVisualize abundance for all orders in relation to land use to see which are most sensitive.\r\nIf I have enough temperature data from this first round of sampling see if temperature mediates invertebrate response to land use (I suspect it does). The moisture data is unfortunately pretty low resolution, but that probably also plays a very important role.\r\nData cleanup\r\nHere is a .csv file with raw data for the invert pilot study:\r\n\r\nDownload Soil invert data.csv\r\n\r\nThis spreadsheet is a combination of the invertebrate abundance data and the collection/extraction metadata, in long format. I will start with some clean up and organization. This involves making sure that R reads my dates as dates, converting my data to long format, splitting the dataset in two (one with unknowns and one without), correcting abundance data for sample mass, and splitting the data into absolute and relative abundance. I use absolute abundance data for calculating diversity indices and relative abundance for community structure modelling.\r\nClick here for code\r\n\r\n\r\ndata <- read.csv('media/working directory/data/soil invert data.csv')\r\n\r\n#load packages\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(gridExtra)\r\nlibrary('funrar')\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\nlibrary(viridis)\r\n\r\n## Initial cleanup, organization\r\n\r\n#make dates recognizable by R\r\ndata$collect.date <- ymd(data$collect.date)\r\n\r\n#Add 0 abundance for unobserved taxa\r\ndata$count[is.na(data$count)] <- 0\r\n\r\n#remove excess rows from dataframe\r\ndata<-data[which(complete.cases(data$collect.date)),]\r\n\r\n#create dataset with unknowns (for total abundance)\r\ndata.unknown<-data\r\n\r\n#create dataset without unknowns (for diversity and community composition)\r\ndata <- subset(data, !taxon == \"Unknown\",)\r\n\r\n#make my data wide for vegan package\r\nwide.data <- data %>%\r\n  pivot_wider(names_from = taxon, values_from = count)\r\n\r\n#make same wide dataframe for data with unknowns\r\nwide.data.unknown <- data.unknown %>%\r\n  pivot_wider(names_from = taxon, values_from = count)\r\n\r\n#Splitting data frame into count and environmental data\r\nwide.data2<-wide.data[,-c(1:12)]     \r\nwide.data3<-wide.data[,-c(13:66)]\r\nwide.data.unknown2<-wide.data.unknown[,-c(1:12)]\r\nwide.data.unknown3<-wide.data.unknown[,-c(13:67)]\r\n\r\n# Converting to count per dry mass\r\n\r\n#converting to count/1000g\r\nwide.data2 <- (1000/wide.data3$dry.mass)*wide.data2\r\nwide.data.unknown2 <- (1000/wide.data.unknown3$dry.mass)*wide.data.unknown2\r\n\r\n#Next I convert mass-corrected absolute abundance to relative abundance, which is used later for total abundance, individual taxon abundance, and community structure modelling. \r\n\r\n#Before the conversion I create data frames backing up the mass-corrected absolute count data for diversity index calculations. \r\n\r\n#Creating versions of the count data that are corrected for mass, but not made relative (for diversity indexes)\r\nwide.data.absolute <- wide.data2\r\nwide.data.unknown.absolute <- wide.data.unknown2\r\n\r\n#reincorporating, and duplicating mass-corrected absolute count data (only doing it for unknowns because this data frame will be used for abundance)\r\nwide.data.unknown[,c(13:67)] <- wide.data.unknown.absolute\r\nwide.data.unknown.absolute2 <- wide.data.unknown\r\n\r\n#converting absolute to relative abundance\r\nwide.data2 <- as.matrix(wide.data2)\r\nwide.data.unknown2 <- as.matrix(wide.data.unknown2)\r\nwide.data2 <- make_relative(wide.data2)\r\nwide.data.unknown2 <- make_relative(wide.data.unknown2)\r\nwide.data2 <- as.data.frame(wide.data2)\r\nwide.data.unknown2 <- as.data.frame(wide.data.unknown2)\r\n\r\n#reincorporating mass-corrected relative count data into original data frame\r\nwide.data[,c(13:66)] <- wide.data2\r\nwide.data.unknown[,c(13:67)] <- wide.data.unknown2\r\n\r\n\r\nNext up I’ll calculate richness, evenness, total abundance, and several diversity indices using the ‘vegan’ R package.

The Simpson index is more heavily influenced by dominant species, while the Shannon index is more heavily influenced by rare species. Going forward I will use Shannon to represent diversity, but if we want we can easily swap in Simpson or something else. Note: sample 53 is anomalous. Never have I seen a mature forest sample with so few inverts. Maybe the reason will become apparent after soil chemistry analysis, or there was an error of some kind during extraction/sample processing.\r\nLet’s summarize averages for each land use type:\r\n\r\nland.use\r\ntaxa\r\nabundance\r\nJ\r\nshannon\r\nsimpson\r\nmature\r\n10.25\r\n75.99087\r\n0.5269801\r\n1.1977923\r\n0.5137903\r\nnat.regen\r\n13.60\r\n133.96823\r\n0.5114752\r\n1.3531473\r\n0.5669626\r\nreforestation\r\n9.20\r\n67.07429\r\n0.5475828\r\n1.1969246\r\n0.5585889\r\nteak\r\n6.60\r\n57.65643\r\n0.6330292\r\n1.1975985\r\n0.5890047\r\npasture\r\n4.60\r\n30.27049\r\n0.4921076\r\n0.7717218\r\n0.3887268\r\n\r\nNow let’s visualize it.\r\nTotal abundance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbundance data is corrected for mass to give values of density per 1000g dry soil. The soil moisture values are based on air-dried samples and mass was recorded with a kitchen scale (low resolution), so moisture is a potential source of error here.\r\nMoisture has a large influence on mass, and can vary considerably (30-50% in the wet season in my experience), so this is a considerable source of error.\r\nTaxonomic Richness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe low richness in teak is perhaps related to nutrient leaching and soil erosion (Fernández-Moya et al 2014, Amponsah & Meyer 2008, Boley et al 2009). Assessing biodiversity via richness has the caveat that rare species weigh pretty heavily on the metric. If a community has 100 individuals of one taxon but only one individual each for a further 9, then it will have a higher richness than a community composed of 8 taxa with 1 individuals each (a more diverse scenario).\r\nShannon Diversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything again excluding AZSOIL053\r\nThese results are somewhat surprising - Mature forest had the greatest abundance and richness in my pilot study. As of 1.7.24 these results are based only on 25 sampling points, once I get the data for the remainder the story will be more complete. I also wonder if sample 53 is single-handedly skewing these results right now?\r\nLet’s redo everything excluding sample 53:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteresting.

During my pilot testing some groups stood out as especially sensitive to land use, lets see if that holds.\r\nVery unfortunately my soil temperature/moisture probe didn’t work, and the new temperature probe I ordered broke shortly after starting soil collections. Consequently, soil moisture data is based on air dried samples weighed with a low-precision scale, and soil temperature values are only available for some of the samples. This is especially unfortunate because I strongly suspect that soil moisture and temperature mediate the effect of land use on soil invertebrates. Mature forests with a full canopy are likely to have more stable temperatures, lower daytime temperatures, and higher soil moisture than young forests or pastureland. Furthermore,the taxa that I found to be most sensitive to temperature during my research on BCI were most sensitive to land use in Azuero.\r\nClick here for setup code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormicidae [Hymenoptera]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColeoptera\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeococcus [Hemiptera]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollembola\r\n\r\n\r\nNULL\r\n\r\nOribatida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Acari\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudoscorpiones\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiplura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSymphyla\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
