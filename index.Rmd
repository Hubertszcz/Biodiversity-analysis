Initial data collection ran from January through March 2024, mostly around Venao, Azuero Peninsula, Panama. The 53 sampling points were distributed across 450 hectares, split between five different land use types: pasture, natural regeneration secondary forest, assisted regeneration (planted) secondary forest, teak plantation, and mature secondary forest.

There were four primary objectives of this research:

- Full-scale test of the biodiversity monitoring system I’ve been designing (monitoring diverse indices, systematically, at scale, in Azuero)

- Establish the amount of time and money to implement each protocol.

- Look at the effect of different reforestation pathways on biodiversity recovery

- Pilot monitoring for Verra’s SDVista Nature Credit system


Here are some data analysis goals:

- Clean up data so that I have richness (and abundance where relevant) values for each protocol at each sampling point, and holistically

- Create accumulation/rarefaction curves to see how effectively I sampled

- Create a summary metric for holistic biodiversity at each sampling point.

- Determine the cost per point of implementing each protocol

- Rank biodiversity indicators for how much time and specialized knowledge is required for their implementation.
